indicator-places
----------------

This is a simple indicator that shows common folders and all bookmarks, the indicator updates automatically if bookmark was added or removed.

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/5310/indicator-places/zipball/master "latest version").
2. Extract the files files to someplace. I recommend `~/.local/bin/indicator-places`.
3. Run indicator-places.py, or add it to the Startup Applications.
